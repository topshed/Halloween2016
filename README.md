# Halloween2016


The idea was simple. Use two 8x8 Bi-colour LED matrices as eyes for the pumpkin that would be 'animated' to look spooky (blinking, looking from side to side etc). The add a PIR sensor to detected nearby movement and play a spooky sound through a speaker connected to the Pi. They eyes would also enter a 'hypno' mode and a string of cheap LED spiders from a pound shop would fade in and out.
