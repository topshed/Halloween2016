The idea was simple. Use two 8x8 Bi-colour LED matrices as eyes for the pumpkin that would be 'animated' to look spooky (blinking, looking from side to side etc).

The add a PIR sensor to detected nearby movement and play a spooky sound through a speaker connected to the  Raspberry Pi. They eyes would also enter a 'hypno' mode and a string of cheap LED spiders from a pound shop would fade in and out.

which can easily all fit inside a reasonably sized pumpkin.
